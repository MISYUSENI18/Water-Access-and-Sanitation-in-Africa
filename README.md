# Water-Access-and-Sanitation-in-Africa
## A Case Study 
The primary goal of this case study is to analyze data, identify patterns, and propose informed, data-driven recommendations that 
governments and stakeholders can implement to effectively improve water access and sanitation in African communities.
### Data Overview  
1. Water Availability and Population Distribution 
This dataset provides insights into the availability of water resources in relation to community populations. 
2. Water Source Type and Functionality 
This dataset explores the distribution of different water sources (borehole, well, river) and their operational status (functional 
vs. non-functional water points). 
3. Sanitation Infrastructure and Maintenance 
This dataset examines the type of sanitation facilities available (toilets vs. latrines) and their associated annual maintenance 
costs. 
4. Support from Governments and NGOs 
This dataset assesses the level of governmental and NGO intervention in water and sanitation projects across different 
communities. 
5. Health and Community Well-being 
This dataset analyzes the correlation between water access, sanitation conditions, and waterborne disease incidence rates. 
6. Community Satisfaction and Accessibility 
This dataset provides insights into the satisfaction levels of communities based on water access, sanitation quality, and 
distance to the nearest water source. 
Key Business Questions 
1. Write an SQL query to calculate the average water availability (liters per capita per day) for each country. 
2. Write an SQL query to retrieve details of communities where at least one water point is non-functional. 
3. Please retrieve the information for the top five communities with the highest annual sanitation maintenance costs. 
4. Calculate the total number of functional and non-functional water points per country 
5. Identify communities with a high incidence of waterborne diseases (>20%) 
6. Find the average distance to the water source per region 
7. List the communities that receive both government and NGO support 
8. Identify the community with the highest population per country
